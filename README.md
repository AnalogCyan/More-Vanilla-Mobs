# More Vanilla Mobs

*More Vanilla Mobs* is a data pack for Minecraft 1.17+ that implements some of the mobs that technically exist in the game, but don't appear in survival.

## Mobs

| Mob                    | Mob Type        | Spawn Chance  |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Wither Skeleton Archer | Wither Skeleton | 25%           |
| Illusioner             | Evoker          | 5%            |
| Killer Bunny           | Rabbit          | 0.1%          |

*Mob Type* indicates which mob's spawn pool it is part of.

*Spawn Chance* indicates the chance it will spawn where said mob type would.

### Why didn't you implement X mob?

If a mob you think should be implemented isn't here, it's either because I couldn't think of a good "vanilla-style" way to implement it, or did not feel if fit in well with the vanilla game.

If you think a certain mob should be implemented, or have thought of a way to implement one, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/AnalogCyan/More-Vanilla-Mobs/issues) to discuss it.
